# Connecting Care with Need

• Tool to provide rapid deployment capability of connecting available goods/services to people in need.

• Cloud-based network of people who need help with providers who can deliver desired help

• Data engine for rapid analysis and pattern recognition

• Quickly configurable to refine request filters and queries

  

# Why Do We Need This?

• The need existed even before the crisis

• Due to quarantines there is a new market of needy people in their homes who need

connectivity and assistance.

• Food pantries/food trucks/etc. need to proactively prepare for demand

• Increased coordination between food pantries and recipients is needed due to no- contact preferences

• Government needs high level visibility into regions with greatest need and into holistic state effort at all four levels of interaction

• Resource coordination efforts need a platform that allows for quick contact with individuals via SMS

## Build

Workaround:
